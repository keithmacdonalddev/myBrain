## Design Patterns to Consider

- **Activity Grid (GitHub Style):** 7 columns (Mon-Sun) × 52 weeks showing year overview; darker color = higher activity
- **Streak Counter:** Prominent display of current streak number with flame emoji and best streak record
- **Completion Percentage:** Ring or arc showing monthly/yearly completion rate (90%, 85%, etc.)
- **Daily Check:** Simple checkbox or tap-to-mark interface, with visual feedback (checkmark, color fill)
- **Stats Cards:** Display total completions, current streak, best streak, completion rate in compact card format
- **Calendar View:** Month view with day circles colored by completion status (filled/empty/partial)

## Color/Style Notes

- **Activity Intensity:** Use grayscale from light gray (no activity) through darker colors (high activity) - GitHub style is very effective
- **Streak Indication:** Use warm orange/red gradient for flames, with brightness indicating streak length
- **Completion States:** Green checkmark for complete, gray/empty for incomplete, orange partial-fill for skipped-once habits
- **Typography:** Bold numbers for streak counters (24-28px), clean sans-serif for labels and dates
- **Spacing:** Tight grid with 2-4px gaps between cells for density; generous margin around grids for breathing room
- **Icons:** Flame for streaks, checkmark for completions, target/goal icon for habits, medal/trophy for achievements
