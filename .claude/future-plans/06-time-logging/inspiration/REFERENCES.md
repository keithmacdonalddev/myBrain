## Design Patterns to Consider

- **Timer Display:** Large, easy-to-read digital clock (00:45:32) with clear font, optionally with large progress ring around it
- **Active Entry Card:** Current running task displayed prominently with stop button, elapsed time, project badge, and quick notes area
- **Quick Start:** One-tap timer start for last used task or quick entry creation with minimal modal dialog
- **Time Entry List:** List of recent/daily entries showing: task name, duration, project, time period, with swipe actions (edit, delete)
- **Duration Picker:** Simple interface for manual time entry with hours/minutes spinners or time range selector (start/end times)
- **Reports View:** Daily/weekly breakdown of time spent on different tasks/projects with bar charts or segment visualization

## Color/Style Notes

- **Timer Display:** Bold, high contrast text (white on dark background is classic and readable); use monospace font for time
- **Active State:** Use animated border or pulsing glow around the running entry to indicate active timer without being distracting
- **Project Colors:** Each project gets a distinct color badge used consistently across entry cards, charts, and tags
- **CTA Buttons:** Bright green for "Start" button, red/orange for "Stop", blue for secondary actions (edit, save)
- **Time Entry Cards:** Light background with left-side project color accent bar for visual scanning and project identification
- **Typography:** Large timer numbers (36-48px), clean sans-serif for labels, smaller text for metadata (time, duration, notes)
