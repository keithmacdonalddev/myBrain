## Design Patterns to Consider

- **Time of Day Heatmap:** Grid showing hours (Y-axis) × days (X-axis) with color intensity for activity level
- **Productive Activity Breakdown:** Donut/pie chart showing allocation: Focus Work (green), Meetings (blue), Communication (orange), etc.
- **Histograms:** Time-of-day distribution showing peak productivity hours, allowing users to identify best work times
- **Trend Lines:** Line charts showing productivity score over time (weekly/monthly), with moving average line overlay
- **Activity Type Rows:** Horizontal bar charts comparing time spent on different categories side-by-side
- **Weekly Comparison Cards:** Metric deltas showing week-over-week changes with percentage and arrow indicators

## Color/Style Notes

- **Heatmap Gradient:** Cool colors (blues) for low activity, warm colors (oranges/reds) for high productivity - intuitive and accessible
- **Donut Charts:** Use maximum 4-6 distinct colors; put central KPI in contrasting color that stands out
- **Activity Categories:** Consistent color palette across all charts (same green for focus work everywhere)
- **Typography:** Large bold numbers for key metrics (16-20px), smaller labels; use monospace fonts for time displays
- **Data Labels:** Direct labeling on pie/donut slices preferred over legend; include percentages for clarity
- **Whitespace:** Generous spacing between charts to prevent cognitive overload; align charts on grid
