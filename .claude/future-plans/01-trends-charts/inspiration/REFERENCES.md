## Design Patterns to Consider

- **Line Charts with Time Selection:** Allow users to zoom/pan timeline data, with visible data points that show values on hover
- **Comparison Bars:** Side-by-side comparison of metrics across time periods (Today vs. Yesterday, Week vs. Week)
- **Sparkline Mini-Charts:** Small inline charts in summary cards showing trend at a glance
- **Interactive Legends:** Clickable legend items to toggle chart series visibility
- **Data Gradients:** Smooth color gradients from cold (low activity) to warm (high activity) for heatmap-style visualizations
- **Time Period Buttons:** Preset filters (1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y) for quick date range selection

## Color/Style Notes

- **Chart Colors:** Use a cohesive palette with 4-5 distinct colors for different metrics/trends; avoid rainbow palettes as they reduce readability
- **Backgrounds:** Light gray or white backgrounds for charts with subtle grid lines for readability without clutter
- **Typography:** Use readable sans-serif fonts for axis labels and legends; keep font size at least 12px for accessibility
- **Emphasis:** Use color saturation and brightness to emphasize primary data series over secondary ones
- **Animation:** Smooth curves and gentle animations on load help users follow data stories
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum); avoid red-green-only differentiation for colorblind users
