- **Progress Rings/Circles:** Visualize completion percentages as visual rings (similar to Apple Activity Rings concept)

## Color/Style Notes

- **Summary Cards:** Light background with colored left border accent to identify section type
- **Achievement Colors:** Green for accomplishments, blue for learnings, orange for obstacles, purple for goals
- **Metrics Styling:** Use large, readable numbers with supporting labels below; add unit suffixes (hrs, %, #)
- **Icons:** Each section should have a clear, recognizable icon for quick scanning
- **Typography Hierarchy:** Large headlines for main metrics, smaller text for context and timestamps
- **Spacing:** Generous whitespace between sections to reduce cognitive load and improve readability
