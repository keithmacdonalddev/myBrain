# Claude Memory

This file persists observations across sessions. Claude should:
- **Read this at session start** to recall context
- **Update it** when patterns or important information emerge
- **Review periodically** to identify automation opportunities

## User Preferences

How the user prefers to work:

| Preference | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Explanation depth | Explain what you're doing, use simple terms (non-coder) |
| Commit reminders | Prompt to commit after completing features |
| Risk warnings | Warn before destructive or hard-to-undo actions |

---

## Decisions Made

Architectural and design decisions (don't revisit these):

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2025-01-20 | Skills over subagents | User prefers explicit control; revisit when automation patterns emerge |
| 2025-01-20 | Wide Events logging pattern | Based on loggingsucks.com; one log per request with full context |

---

## Repetitive Tasks

Track tasks done multiple times - candidates for automation:

| Task | Count | Last Seen | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Manual sync-docs | 1 | 2025-01-20 | Created /sync-docs skill |
| Manual checkpoint | 1 | 2025-01-20 | Created /checkpoint skill |

**Threshold:** When count reaches 3+, suggest creating a skill or subagent.

## Failed Approaches

Things that didn't work - don't try again:

| Date | What We Tried | Why It Failed |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 2025-01-20 | Skills in `.claude/agents/` | Wrong location; must be `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
