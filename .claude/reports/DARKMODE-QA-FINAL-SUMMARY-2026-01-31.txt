TEST ACCOUNT
============

Email:       claude-test-admin@mybrain.test
Password:    ClaudeTest123
Environment: Both dev (localhost:5173) and production
Database:    Shared MongoDB (same in dev/prod)

================================================================================

VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
=========================

Quality Standard: "Better than 100%" (User Standard)
  - Barely readable = FAIL (must fix)
  - Clearly visible at a glance = PASS

Evidence Requirement: EVERY claim must have screenshot proof
  - No "PASS" without verification
  - Use browser inspector (F12) to confirm colors
  - Document actual vs. expected values

Severity Levels:
  CRITICAL: Text unreadable (contrast < 3:1)
  SERIOUS:  Hard to read (contrast < 4.5:1)
  MINOR:    Slightly off but usable

================================================================================

CRITICAL CONTEXT (From Previous Failures)
==========================================

Previous Session Issues:
  - Agents repeatedly said "PASS" without evidence
  - User showed screenshots of obvious failures
  - Root cause: agents lacked context
  - Solution: Full context provided in multiple documents

This Session:
  - Complete context provided in 6 detailed documents
  - Evidence required for ALL claims
  - Screenshot every finding
  - Use browser inspector to verify colors
  - Document actual colors vs. expected colors

Result Expected:
  - Comprehensive report with all issues documented
  - Every issue has screenshot proof
  - All severity levels assigned accurately
  - All colors verified with computed values

TESTING WORKFLOW
================

STEP 1: PREPARATION (10 minutes)
  □ Read master checklist
  □ Read agent context document
  □ Enable dark mode in app
  □ Open browser dev tools (F12)

STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC TESTING (2-3 hours)
  For each of 10 pages:
  □ Take full page screenshot
  □ Verify text contrast (all text readable?)
  □ Check background colors (match design system?)
  □ Test interactive elements (all visible?)
  □ Document any issues

  Per Issue Found:
  □ Take screenshot of problem area
  □ Use browser inspector to get exact colors
  □ Record in master issues table
  □ Assign severity level

STEP 3: DOCUMENTATION (30 minutes)
  □ Complete master issues table
  □ Organize all screenshots
  □ Create final report
  □ Verify all deliverables

STEP 4: VERIFICATION (15 minutes)
  □ Final quality check
  □ All issues have evidence
  □ All colors documented
  □ All severity levels correct

Total Estimated Time: 3-4 hours for comprehensive testing

================================================================================

HOW TO START
============

Option 1: Manual Testing with Browser
  1. Open app and login (test account provided)
  2. Enable dark mode
  3. Open browser dev tools (F12)
  4. Follow master checklist page-by-page
  5. Take screenshots
  6. Document issues
  7. Generate report

Option 2: Agent-Based Testing
  1. Agent reads all context documents
  2. Agent uses agent-browser with --session darkmode-qa
  3. Agent follows master checklist systematically
  4. Agent takes screenshots and verifies with inspector
  5. Agent documents all findings
  6. Agent generates final report

Both Options:
  - Use master checklist (most detailed guide)
  - Use agent context (specifications)
  - Screenshot everything
  - Use browser inspector to verify colors
  - No claim without evidence

CRITICAL REMINDERS
==================

1. EVIDENCE IS REQUIRED
   Every claim must have screenshot proof
   Use browser inspector to verify colors
   Document actual vs. expected values

2. QUALITY STANDARD
   User standard is "better than 100%"
   Barely readable = FAIL
   Clearly visible at a glance = PASS

3. SEVERITY MATTERS
   CRITICAL: Text unreadable (< 3:1 contrast)
   SERIOUS: Hard to read (< 4.5:1 contrast)
   MINOR: Usable but wrong color

4. DESIGN SYSTEM IS AUTHORITATIVE
   Use color values from design-system.md
   Theme selector is .dark class
   Red only for TRUE errors

5. SCREENSHOTS ARE PROOF
   Take screenshots for every finding
   Save to .claude/design/screenshots/qa/darkmode/
   Include in final report
