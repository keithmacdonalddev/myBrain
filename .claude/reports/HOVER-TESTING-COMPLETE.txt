✓ Smooth 60fps animation expected
✓ Mobile optimized (no hover on touch devices)
✓ Reduced motion respected (performance + accessibility)

================================================================================
DESIGN SYSTEM COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

V2 CSS Variables: 13 used correctly
  ✓ --v2-bg-surface-hover
  ✓ --v2-accent-primary
  ✓ --v2-status-error
  ✓ --v2-status-success
  ✓ --v2-separator
  ✓ --v2-border-default/strong
  ✓ --v2-shadow-sm/md
  ✓ --v2-text-primary/secondary/tertiary
  ✓ +5 more

CSS Best Practices:
  ✓ Proper transition syntax
  ✓ Correct transform usage
  ✓ Semantic class naming
  ✓ Proper dark mode variable scoping
  ✓ Reduced motion support
  ✓ Responsive design patterns
  ✓ Z-index management
  ✓ Focus-visible pseudo-class usage

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
================================================================================

Optional Improvements (Not blocking):
  1. Consider tooltip support for less obvious hover targets
  2. Activity Log hover effect could be slightly more prominent
  3. Consider adding "press" animation on click (active state)
  4. Review cursor types (grab, move for draggable elements)

Maintenance Notes:
  - Keep transition timing consistent when adding new components
  - Always include dark mode overrides
  - Test hover states with prefers-reduced-motion
  - Test on mobile to ensure no hover-dependent UI
  - Verify focus states for keyboard navigation

================================================================================
