  Description: No table button in editor toolbar
  Impact: Users may expect table creation ability
  Recommendation: Document whether tables are planned or add feature
  Blocking: No - noted as potential future feature

LOW PRIORITY: 2 Issues

Issue 3: Image Upload Not Fully Tested
  Severity: Low
  Description: Image paste/upload functionality not comprehensively validated
  Recommendation: Add dedicated image handling test in future QA
