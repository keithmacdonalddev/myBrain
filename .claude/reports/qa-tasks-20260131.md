### ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND

#### Low Priority - Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Due Date Calculation Across Timezones**
   - **Description:** Date comparisons use local timezone, which could be inconsistent if user travels or changes system time
   - **Impact:** "Today" badge might show incorrect due date grouping
   - **Evidence:** Code uses `new Date()` for comparisons (line 226-232 in TasksList.jsx)
   - **Recommendation:** Consider using UTC-based date calculations or clarifying timezone handling in documentation

2. **Long Task Titles Without Hyphenation**
   - **Description:** Very long titles (500+ characters without spaces) could break layout in mobile view
   - **Impact:** Visual overflow of task card width
   - **Test Case:** Create task with title: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" (150+ chars)
   - **Recommendation:** Add CSS word-break: break-word or max-width constraint with ellipsis on task titles

3. **Empty Search Results Message**
   - **Description:** When search returns no results, message says "No tasks match your filters" but it's actually search not matching
   - **Impact:** Slightly confusing UX when user only has search active, no other filters
   - **Recommendation:** Differentiate message for search-only vs filter-only vs both

4. **Overdue Calculation for Tasks Due at Different Times**
   - **Description:** Overdue calculation based on date only, ignoring time component
   - **Impact:** A task due at 11:59 PM tomorrow won't show as overdue until the next day at 12:00 AM
   - **Current Behavior:** Task is considered not overdue until date passes completely
   - **Recommendation:** Consider time component in overdue calculations if time input is supported

5. **No Indication of Unsaved Changes in Detail Panel**
   - **Description:** When editing task details, no visual indicator shows pending changes before auto-save
   - **Impact:** User might close panel thinking changes are lost
   - **Current:** Auto-save happens after inactivity (SaveStatus component exists)
   - **Recommendation:** Show "Saving..." or "Unsaved changes" indicator during edit

#### None of the following issues were found:
- ✅ No form validation gaps (title required, validated properly)
- ✅ No UI glitches during CRUD operations
- ✅ No state not updating after changes (optimistic updates working)
- ✅ No inconsistent styling between states (styling matrix complete)
- ✅ No accessibility regressions (ARIA labels complete, keyboard nav working)

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Code Quality
1. **Add word-break CSS** to task titles to handle very long text without spaces
2. **Document timezone behavior** in task due date comparison logic
3. **Add visual save indicator** to task edit panel (in progress indicator)

### Priority 2: User Experience
1. **Differentiate search vs. filter messages** in empty state
2. **Consider time-based overdue calculations** if task time input supported
3. **Add toast notification** on task creation confirming success

### Priority 3: Testing
1. Run existing test suite to verify coverage (tests exist in `.test.jsx` files)
2. Add E2E tests for complex workflows (multi-filter + search)
3. Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS) for WCAG AAA compliance
