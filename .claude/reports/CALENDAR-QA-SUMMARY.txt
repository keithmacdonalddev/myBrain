CALENDAR PAGE QA REPORT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
Date: 2026-01-31
Environment: Development (localhost:5173)
Report: qa-calendar-2026-01-31.md
================================================================================

OVERALL STATUS: GOOD - Implementation quality is solid, but live testing required

Code Quality: ✅ GOOD
- Clean architecture with 5 main components
- Proper separation of concerns (container, views, sidebar)
- Handles most common use cases
- ~2,000 lines well-organized code

Risk Level: ⚠️ MEDIUM
- Several edge cases need verification through live testing
- Some potential data integrity issues around time zones
- Mobile touch target sizes may be below standards

================================================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND (Must test in live environment)
================================================================================

1. ❌ ALL-DAY EVENTS NOT SHOWN IN WEEK VIEW
   Location: WeekView.jsx line 103
   Issue: Code explicitly filters out all-day events
   Impact: User creates all-day event, switches to week view, event vanishes
   Severity: CRITICAL

2. ❌ MULTI-DAY EVENTS ONLY SHOW ON START DATE IN WEEK/DAY VIEWS
   Location: WeekView.jsx line 23-24
   Issue: Uses exact date match instead of range check
   Impact: 5-day event only shows on first day in week view
   Severity: HIGH

3. ❌ OVERLAPPING EVENTS RENDER ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
   Location: WeekView.jsx line 144, DayView.jsx line 120
   Issue: Absolute positioning without collision detection
   Impact: Multiple events at same time become unreadable/unclickable
   Severity: HIGH

4. ❌ "PLUS N MORE" BUTTON NOT CLICKABLE IN MONTH VIEW
   Location: MonthView.jsx line 128-131
   Issue: No onClick handler implemented
   Impact: Can't expand to see all events for a crowded day
   Severity: HIGH

5. ⚠️  TIME ZONE HANDLING NOT VERIFIED
   Location: Throughout (uses new Date())
   Issue: No visible timezone conversion
   Impact: Could cause data corruption if API returns UTC
   Severity: CRITICAL (if backend issue exists)

================================================================================
HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUES (Test + Fix Before Production)
================================================================================

✓ Event color accessibility verification
✓ Mobile touch target sizes (< 44px minimum)
✓ Very long event titles overflow in DayView
✓ Navigation buttons lack disabled state
✓ Event title field might allow empty values

================================================================================
FEATURES IMPLEMENTED & STATUS
================================================================================

Views:
  ✅ Month View (6-week grid, today highlight, event indicators)
  ✅ Week View (7-day timeline with hourly grid)
  ✅ Day View (24-hour detailed view with all-day section)
  ✅ Navigation (prev/next for all views, back to today)

Components:
  ✅ Main calendar with 3 view modes
  ✅ Mini calendar sidebar (on lg+ screens)
  ✅ Upcoming events sidebar
  ✅ Event creation/editing modal
  ✅ Event deletion with confirmation

Event Types:
  ✅ All-day events
  ✅ Timed events
  ✅ Recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, custom)
  ✅ Multi-day events
  ✅ Events with location
  ✅ Events with description (rich text)
  ✅ Event colors (7 color palette)
  ✅ Task/note linking to events

Mobile/Responsive:
  ✅ Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  ✅ Mobile header with plus button
  ✅ Simplified controls on mobile
  ✅ Sidebar hidden on small screens

================================================================================
TEST RESULTS NEEDED
================================================================================

To fully verify the issues, testing should cover:

MUST TEST (Expected Failures):
  □ Create all-day event, switch to week view (event should disappear)
  □ Create 5-day event, view in week view (should only show on day 1)
  □ Create 2 events at same time (9-10 AM, 9:30-10:30 AM) (overlap)
  □ Create event on 30th with "+N more" text, try clicking it (does nothing?)
  □ Create event 11 PM - 1 AM, check both days

SHOULD TEST (Quality):
  □ Event title with 100 characters (truncation?)
  □ Month with 30+ events in one day (rendering?)
  □ 10 overlapping events in day view (readability?)
  □ Yellow color events (contrast ratio?)
  □ Mobile touch targets (size adequate?)

COULD TEST (Edge Cases):
  □ Navigate to year 2025 and 2027
  □ Navigate to year 2100
  □ Create event spanning new year boundary
  □ Create recurring event, modify one instance
  □ Task/note linking functionality
  □ Location picker functionality

================================================================================
TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Phase 1 - Critical Path (Day 1):
  1. Verify all-day events in week view (expect to fail)
  2. Verify multi-day events in week/day views
  3. Verify overlapping event handling
  4. Verify "+N more" clickability
  5. Verify time zone handling

Phase 2 - Quality (Day 2):
  1. Mobile responsive testing (all breakpoints)
  2. Touch target verification (44px minimum)
  3. Color accessibility (WCAG AA contrast)
  4. Very long titles handling
  5. Large event counts (30+ per day)

Phase 3 - Edge Cases (Day 3):
  1. Spanning midnight events
  2. Year boundary events
  3. Recurring event modifications
  4. Task/note linking
  5. Location picker

NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Run live testing with agent-browser and test account
2. Document actual behavior vs expected behavior
3. Create issues for each confirmed bug
4. Prioritize fixes based on impact
5. Implement fixes and re-test

Estimated testing time: 2-3 hours
Estimated fix time: 4-8 hours (depending on issues)
